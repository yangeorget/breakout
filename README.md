breakout

A breakout game in GFA.

In the mid 80's, I had an Atari ST and I enjoyed writing very useless programs such as GFA-punches: short GFA programs (less than 20 lines) that had to be cool.

Among others, I wrote a 17 lines long breakout game.
Laurent Vogel, who is, as you can guess, an old friend of mine, had fortunately kept the source.

Here is the output of the original program emulated by the Steem engine on my PC: https://github.com/yangeorget/breakout/wiki.
