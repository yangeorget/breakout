breakout
========

A breakout game in GFA.

In the mid 80's, I had an Atari ST and I enjoyed writing very useless programs such as GFA-punches: short GFA programs (less than 20 lines) that had to be cool.

Among others, I wrote a 17 lines long breakout game.
Laurent Vogel, who is, as you can guess, an old friend of mine, had fortunately kept the source.
